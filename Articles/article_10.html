            <h3>What Is RAM (Random Access Memory)?</h3><br>

            <p>Random access memory (RAM) is the hardware in a computing device that provides temporary storage for the
                operating system (OS), software programs and any other data in current use so they're quickly available
                to
                the device's processor. RAM is often referred to as a computer's main memory, as opposed to the
                processor
                cache or other memory types.</p><br>

            <p>Random access memory is considered part of a computer's primary memory. It is much faster to read from
                and
                write to than secondary storage, such as hard disk drives (HDDs), solid-state drives (SSDs) or optical
                drives. However, RAM is volatile; it retains data only as long as the computer is on. If power is lost,
                so
                is the data. When the computer is rebooted, the OS and other files must be reloaded into RAM, usually
                from
                an HDD or SSD.</p>

            <h3>How Does RAM Work ?</h3><br>

            <p>The term random access, or direct access, as it applies to RAM is based on the facts that any storage
                location can be accessed directly via its memory address and that the access can be random. RAM is
                organized
                and controlled in a way that enables data to be stored and retrieved directly to and from specific
                locations. Other types of storage -- such as an HDD or CD-ROM -- can also be accessed directly and
                randomly,
                but the term random access isn't used to describe them.</p><br>

            <p>Originally, the term random access memory was used to distinguish regular core memory from offline
                memory.
                Offline memory typically referred to magnetic tape from which a specific piece of data could be accessed
                only by locating the address sequentially, starting at the beginning of the tape.</p><br>

            <p>RAM is similar in concept to a set of boxes organized into columns and rows, with each box holding either
                a
                0 or a 1 (binary). Each box has a unique address that is determined by counting across the columns and
                down
                the rows. A set of RAM boxes is called an array, and each box is known as a cell.</p><br>

            <p>To find a specific cell, the RAM controller sends the column and row address down a thin electrical line
                etched into the chip. Each row and column in a RAM array has its own address line. Any data that's read
                from
                the array is returned on a separate data line.</p><br>

            <p>RAM is physically small and stored in microchips. The microchips are gathered into memory modules, which
                plug into slots in a computer's motherboard. A bus, or a set of electrical paths, is used to connect the
                motherboard slots to the processor.</p><br>

            <p>RAM is also small in terms of the amount of data it can hold. A typical laptop computer might come with 8
                GB
                or 16 GB of RAM, while a hard disk might hold 10 TB of data. A hard drive stores data on a magnetized
                surface that looks like a vinyl record. Alternatively, an SSD stores data in memory chips that, unlike
                RAM,
                are non-volatile. They don't require constant power and won't lose data if the power is turned off.</p>
            <br>

            <h3>How Much RAM Do You Need ?</h3><br>

            <p>PCs enable users to add RAM modules up to a certain limit. Having more RAM in a computer cuts down on
                the number of times the processor must read data from the hard disk or solid-state drive, an operation
                that
                takes longer than reading data from RAM. RAM access times are in nanoseconds, while storage access times
                are
                in milliseconds.</p><br>

            <p>Random access memory can hold only a limited amount of data, much less than secondary storage such as an
                SSD
                or HDD. If RAM fills up and additional data is needed, the system must free up space in RAM for the new
                data. This process might involve moving data temporarily to secondary storage, often by swapping or
                paging
                files. Such operations can significantly affect performance, which is why it's important that a system
                has
                enough RAM to support its workloads.</p><br>

            <p>The amount of RAM needed depends on how the system is being used. When video editing, for example, it's
                recommended that a system have at least 16 GB RAM, though more is desirable. For image editing in
                Photoshop,
                Adobe recommends a system have at least 8 GB of RAM to run Photoshop Creative Cloud on a Mac. However,
                if
                the user is working with multiple applications at the same time, even 8 GB of RAM might not be enough
                and
                performance will suffer.</p><br>

            <h3>Types Of RAM</h3><br>

            <p>RAM comes in two primary forms:</p><br>

            <ul>
                <li>Dynamic random access memory (DRAM) : DRAM is typically used for a computer's main memory. As was
                    previously
                    noted, it needs continuous power to retain stored data. DRAM is cheaper than SRAM and offers a
                    higher
                    density, but it produces more heat, consumes more power and is not as fast as SRAM.</li><br>

                <p>Each DRAM cell stores a positive or negative charge held in an electrical capacitor. This data must
                    be
                    constantly refreshed with an electronic charge every few milliseconds to compensate for leaks from
                    the
                    capacitor. A transistor serves as a gate, determining whether a capacitor's value can be read or
                    written.</p><br>

                <li>Static random access memory (SRAM). This type of RAM is typically used for the system's high speed
                    cache,
                    such as L1 or L2. Like DRAM, SRAM also needs constant power to hold on to data, but it doesn't need
                    to be
                    continually refreshed the way DRAM does. SRAM is more expensive than DRAM and has a lower density,
                    but it
                    produces less heat, consumes less power and offers better performance.</li><br>

                <p>In SRAM, instead of a capacitor holding the charge, the transistor acts as a switch, with one
                    position
                    serving as 1 and the other position as 0. Static RAM requires several transistors to retain one bit
                    of data
                    compared to dynamic RAM, which needs only one transistor per bit. This is why SRAM chips are much
                    larger and
                    more expensive than an equivalent amount of DRAM.
                    Because of the differences between SRAM and DRAM, SRAM is mainly used in small amounts, most notably
                    as
                    cache memory inside a computer's processor.</p><br>
