            <h3>What Is Software?</h3><br>

            <p>Software is a set of instructions, data or programs used to operate computers and execute specific tasks.
                It is the opposite of hardware, which describes the physical aspects of a computer. Software is a
                generic term
                used to refer to applications, scripts and programs that run on a device. It can be thought of as the
                variable part of a computer, while hardware is the invariable part.</p><br>

            <p>The two main categories of software are application software and system software. An application is
                software that fulfills a specific need or performs tasks. System software is designed to run a
                computer's
                hardware and provides a platform for applications to run on top of.</p><br>

            <p>Other types of software include the following:</p><br>

            <ul>
                <li>Programming software, which provides the programming tools software developers need.</li><br>
                <li>Middleware, which sits between system software and applications.</li><br>
                <li>Driver software, which operates computer devices and peripherals.</li><br>
            </ul>

            <p>Early software was written for specific computers and sold with the hardware it ran on. In the 1980s,
                software began to be sold on floppy disks and, later, CDs and DVDs. Today, most software is purchased
                and
                directly downloaded over the internet. Software can be found on vendor and application service provider
                websites.</p><br>

            <h3>Examples And Types Of Software</h3><br>

            <p>Among the various categories of software, the most common types include the following:</p><br>

            <ul>
                <li>Application software : The most frequently used software is application software, which is a
                    computer
                    software package that performs a specific function for a user or, in some cases, for another
                    application. An
                    application can be self-contained, or it can be a group of programs that run the application for the
                    user.
                    Examples of modern applications include office suites, graphics software, databases, database
                    management
                    programs, web browsers, word processors, software development tools, image editors and communication
                    platforms.</li><br>

                <li>System software : These software programs are designed to run a computer's application programs and
                    hardware.
                    System software coordinates the activities and functions of the hardware and software. In addition,
                    it
                    controls the operations of the computer hardware and provides an environment or platform for all the
                    other
                    types of software to work in. An operating system (OS) is the best example of system software; it
                    manages
                    all the other computer programs. Other examples of system software include firmware, computer
                    language
                    translators and system utilities.</li><br>

                <li>Driver software : Also known as device drivers, this software is often considered a type of system
                    software.
                    Device drivers control the devices and peripherals connected to a computer, helping them perform
                    their
                    specific tasks. Every device that's connected to a computer needs at least one device driver to
                    function.
                    Examples include software that comes with any nonstandard hardware, including special game
                    controllers,
                    as
                    well as the software that enables standard hardware, such as USB storage devices, keyboards,
                    headphones
                    and
                    printers.</li><br>

                <li>Middleware : The term middleware describes software that mediates between application and system
                    software
                    or
                    between two different kinds of application software. For example, middleware lets Microsoft Windows
                    talk
                    to
                    Excel and Word. It's used to send a remote work request from an application in a computer that has
                    one
                    kind
                    of OS to an application in a computer with a different OS. It also lets newer applications work with
                    legacy
                    ones.</li><br>

                <li>Programming software : Computer programmers use programming software to write code. Programming
                    software
                    and
                    programming languages, such as Java or Python, let developers develop, write, test and debug other
                    software
                    programs. Examples of programming software include assemblers, compilers, debuggers and
                    interpreters.
