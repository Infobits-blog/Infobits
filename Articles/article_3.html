            <h3>How Does Software Work?</h3><br>

            <p>All software provides the directions and data computers need to work and meet users' needs. However, the
                two
                different types -- application software and system software -- work in distinctly different ways.</p>
            <br>

            <h3>Application software</h3><br>

            <p>Application software consists of many programs that perform specific functions for end users, such as
                writing reports and navigating websites. Applications also perform tasks for other applications.
                Applications on a computer can't run on their own; they require a computer's OS along with other
                supporting
                system software programs to work.</p><br>

            <p>These desktop applications are installed on a user's computer and use the computer memory to carry out
                tasks. They take up space on the computer's hard drive and don't need an internet connection to work.
                However, desktop applications must adhere to the requirements of the hardware devices they run on.</p>
            <br>

            <p>Web applications, on the other hand, do require internet access to work, but they don't rely on the
                hardware
                and system software to run. Consequently, users can launch web applications from devices that have a web
                browser. Since the components responsible for the application functionality are on the server, users can
                launch the app from Windows, Mac, Linux or any other OS.</p><br>

            <h3>System Software</h3><br>

            <p>System software sits between the computer hardware and the application software. Users don't interact
                directly with system software as it runs in the background, handling the basic functions of the
                computer.
                This software coordinates a system's hardware and software so users can run high-level application
                software
                to perform specific actions. System software executes when a computer system boots up and continues
                running
                as long as the system is on.</p>
