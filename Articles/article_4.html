            <h3>Design And Implementation Of Software</h3><br>

            <p>The software development lifecycle is a framework that project managers use to describe the stages and
                tasks
                associated with designing software. The first steps in the design lifecycle are planning the effort,
                then
                analyzing the needs of the individuals who will use the software and creating detailed requirements.
                After
                the initial requirements analysis, the design phase aims to specify how to fulfill those user
                requirements.</p><br>

            <p>The next is step is implementation, where development work is completed, and then software testing
                happens.
                The maintenance phase involves any tasks required to keep the system running.</p><br>

            <p>design includes a description of the structure of the software that will be implemented, data
                models, interfaces between system components and potentially the algorithms the software engineer will
                use.</p><br>

            <p>The software design process transforms user requirements into a form that computer programmers can use to
                do
                the software coding and implementation. Software engineers develop the software design iteratively,
                adding
                detail and correcting the design as they develop it.</p><br>

            <p>The different types of software design include the following:</p><br>

            <ul>
                <li>Architectural design : This is the foundational design, which identifies the overall structure of
                    the system,
                    its main components and their relationships with one another using architectural design tools.</li>
                <br>

                <li>High-level design : This is the second layer of design that focuses on how the system, along with
                    all its
                    components, can be implemented in forms of modules supported by a software stack. A high-level
                    design
                    describes the relationships between data flow and the various modules and functions of the system.
                </li><br>

                <li>Detailed design : This third layer of design focuses on all the implementation details necessary for
                    the
                    specified architecture.</li>
            </ul>
