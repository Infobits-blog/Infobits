            <h3>What Is An Operating System (OS)?</h3><br>

            <p>An operating system (OS) is the program that, after being initially loaded into the computer by a boot
                program, manages all the other application programs in a computer. The application programs use the OS
                by
                requesting services through a defined application program interface (API). In addition, users can
                interact
                directly with the operating system through a user interface (UI), such as a command-line interface (CLI)
                or
                a graphical user interface (GUI).</p><br>

            <h3>What Does An Operating System Do?</h3><br>

            <p>An operating system brings powerful benefits to computer software and software development. Without an
                operating system, which is system software specifically designed to run the computer, every application
                would need to include its own UI, as well as the comprehensive code needed to handle all low-level
                functionality of the underlying computer's system software, such as disk storage and network interfaces.
                Considering the vast array of underlying hardware available, and the number of software routines that
                must
                be run at the system software level to support computer functions, this would bloat the size of every
                application and make software development impractical.</p><br>

            <p>Instead, the OS handles many system-level software tasks, including sending a network packet or
                displaying
                text on a standard output device, such as a display. The system software serves as an intermediary
                between
                the applications and the underlying computer and hardware functions. The OS provides a consistent and
                repeatable way for applications to interact with the hardware and other system-level functions without
                the
                applications needing to know any details about them.</p><br>

            <p>If each application accesses the same resources and services in the same way, the OS -- and the
                underlying
                systems software with which it engages -- can service almost any number of applications. This vastly
                reduces
                the amount of time and coding required to develop and debug an application, while ensuring that users
                can
                control, configure and manage system software and hardware through a common and well-understood OS
                interface.</p><br>

            <h3>How Does An Operating System Work?</h3><br>

            <p>Once installed, an operating system relies on a large library of device drivers to tailor its services to
                the specific hardware environment. For example, every application could make a common call to a storage
                device. The OS receives that call and uses the corresponding driver to translate the call into actions,
                or
                commands, needed for the underlying hardware on that specific computer. The operating system provides a
                comprehensive platform that identifies, configures and manages the following:</p><br>

            <ul>

                <li>A range of hardware, including processors.</li><br>
                <li> Memory devices and computer memory management.</li><br>
                <li>Chipsets.</li><br>
                <li>Storage.</li><br>
                <li>Networking.</li><br>
                <li>Port communication interfaces, such as Video Graphics Array, High-Definition Multimedia
                    Interface and
                    Universal Serial Bus (USB).</li><br>
                <li>Subsystem interfaces, such as Peripheral Component Interconnect Express.</li><br>
            </ul>

            <h3>What Are The Functions Of An Operating System ?</h3><br>

            <p>All major computer platforms -- both hardware and software -- typically require and include an
                OS that must
                be developed with different features to meet the specific needs of various device form factors.</p><br>

            <p>From an end user's perspective, an operating system provides the following three essential
                capabilities:</p><br>

            <ul>
                <li>Offers a UI through a CLI or GUI.</li><br>
                <li>Launches applications and manages application execution.</li><br>
                <li>Identifies and determines the allocation of system hardware resources such as printers and
                    backup disk drives to those applications, typically through a standardized API.</li><br>
            </ul>

            <h3>User Interface</h3><br>

            <p>The user can interact with the computer to do work either through a GUI, which is a
                point-and-click visual
                screen that contains icons that trigger system functions and launch applications, a CLI, which
                consists of a
                single command line for data entry, or both.</p><br>

            <h3>Application Management</h3><br>

            <p>An operating system handles the launch and management of every application, which supports the
                following
                functions:</p><br>

            <ul>
                <li>Timesharing multiple processes, or threads, so that various tasks can share the available
                    processors'
                    resources.</li><br>

                <li>Manages interruptions that applications produce to gain a processor's immediate attention,
                    ensuring there's
                    enough memory to execute the application and its corresponding data without interfering with
                    other
                    processes.</li><br>

                <li>Carries out error handling that can remove an application's processes.
                    Perform memory management without disrupting other applications or the OS.</li><br>
            </ul>

            <h3>Hardware Provisioning And Execution</h3><br>

            <p>An operating system can also support APIs that enable applications to use OS and hardware
                functions without
                the need to know anything about the low-level OS or hardware state. For example, a Windows API
                can enable a
                program to obtain input from a keyboard or mouse; create GUI elements, such as dialog windows
                and buttons;
                and read and write files to a storage device. Applications are almost always tailored to use the
                OS system
                on which the application intends to run.</p><br>

            <h3>Process Scheduling And Prioritization</h3><br>

            <p>In a multitasking operating system, where multiple programs can be running at the same time, the
                OS
                determines in which order applications should run and how much time should be allowed for each
                application
                before giving another application a turn. For example, the OS can determine if a batch job, such
                as a large
                printing task, can be scheduled to run later when resources are free.</p><br>

            <h3>Parallel Processing</h3><br>

            <p>On computers that can provide parallel processing, an OS manages how to divide a program so that
                it runs on
                more than one processor at a time.</p><br>

            <h3>File Management</h3><br>

            <p>Per user request, IT rulesets or default settings, an operating system manages the creation,
                access,
                modification and deletion of files and directories.</p><br>

            <h3>Networking</h3><br>

            <p>Transparent to the user, the OS automatically connects a workstation to networkwide resources by
                deciphering
                network protocols and connecting to networks. This enables a single user to access network
                printers and
                servers that are hosted on the network.</p><br>

            <h3>Security</h3><br>

            <p>Using policies defined and authorized by IT, the OS enforces security access controls and
                encryption for
                users, applications and data.</p><br>

            <h3>Performance Monitoring And Error Detection</h3><br>

            <p>The OS continually monitors computer performance and produces system logs that assist in
                fine-tuning for
                optimal performance and resolving issues that concern resource utilization, performance
                slowdowns and
                bottlenecks, and error resolution.</p><br>

            <h3>Backup And Recovery</h3><br>

            <p>Data can be backed up periodically throughout the day, nightly, weekly or at whatever frequency
                that's
                defined. The OS can perform these backups automatically, without user or IT assistance. If a
                data outage or
                system failure occurs, data can easily be recovered from the latest backup.</p><br>

            <h3>Virtualization</h3><br>

            <p>Most OSes enable users to define multiple operating systems that run independently of each other
                by using
                software-created partitions that separate each OS from the others on a single physical
                workstation. This
                enables the user to run multiple applications, each with their own dedicated OS, simultaneously
                on a single
                workstation to optimize performance.</p><br>

            <h3>Device Management</h3><br>

            <p>An operating system identifies, configures and provides applications with common access to
                underlying
                input/output devices such as printers, keyboards and other computer hardware devices. As the OS
                recognizes
                and identifies hardware, it installs corresponding device drivers and interfaces that enable the
                OS and
                applications running on the OS to use the devices.</p><br>

            <p>An operating system identifies the correct printer and installs the appropriate printer drivers
                so that an
                application needs to only make calls to the printer without having to use codes or commands that
                are
                specific to that printer. The process is similar for other devices, including the following:</p><br>

            <ul>
                <li>USB ports.</li><br>
                <li>Networking ports.</li><br>
                <li>Graphics devices, such as graphics processing units.
                    Motherboard chipsets.</li><br>
                <li>Storage devices, such as Serial-Attached SCSI disk adapters and disks that are formatted with a
                    suitable
                    file system.</li><br>
            </ul>

            <p>The OS identifies and configures physical and logical devices for service and typically records
                them in a
                standardized structure, such as Windows Registry. Device manufacturers periodically patch and
                update
                drivers, and the OS should update them to ensure optimal device performance and security. When
                devices are
                replaced, the OS also installs and configures new drivers.</p>
