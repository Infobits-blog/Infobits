            <h3>What Is Computer Hardware?</h3><br>

            <p>Computer hardware is a collective term used to describe any of the physical components of an analog
                or digital computer. The term hardware distinguishes the tangible aspects of a computing device from
                software, which consists of written, machine-readable instructions or programs that tell physical
                components what to do and when to execute the instructions.</p><br>

            <p>Hardware and software are complementary. A computing device can function efficiently and produce
                useful output only when both hardware and software work together appropriately.</p><br>

            <p>Computer hardware can be categorized as being either internal or external components. Generally,
                internal hardware components are those necessary for the proper functioning of the computer, while
                external hardware components are attached to the computer to add or enhance functionality.</p><br><br>

            <h3>What Are Internal Computer Hardware Components?</h3><br>

            <p>Internal components collectively process or store the instructions delivered by the program or
                operating system (OS). These include the following:</p><br>

            <ul>
                <li>Motherboard : This is a printed circuit board that holds the central processing unit (CPU) and
                    other essential internal hardware and functions as the central hub that all other hardware
                    components run through.</li><br>

                <li>CPU : The CPU is the brain of the computer that processes and executes digital instructions from
                    various programs; its clock speed determines the computer's performance and efficiency in
                    processing data.</li><br>

                <li>RAM : RAM or dynamic RAM is temporary memory storage that makes information immediately
                    accessible to programs; RAM is volatile memory, so stored data is cleared when the computer
                    powers off.</li><br>

                <li>Hard drive : Hard disk drives are physical storage devices that store both permanent and
                    temporary data indifferent formats, including programs, OSes, device files, photos, etc.</li>
                <br>

                <li>Solid-state drive (SSD) : SSDs are solid-state storage devices based on NAND flash memory
                    technology; SSDs are non-volatile, so they can safely store data even when the computer is
                    powered down.</li><br>


                <li>Optical drive : Optical drives typically reside in an on-device drive bay; they enable the
                    computer to read and interact with nonmagnetic external media, such as compact disc read-only
                    memory or digital video discs.</li><br>

                <li>Heat sink : This is a passive piece of hardware that draws heat away from components to
                    regulate/reduce their temperature to help ensure they continue to function properly. Typically,
                    a heat sink is installed directly atop the CPU, which produces the most heat among internal
                    components.</li><br>

                <li>Graphics processing unit : This chip-based device processes graphical data and often functions
                    as an extension to the main CPU.</li><br>

                <li>Network interface card (NIC) : A NIC is a circuit board or chip that enables the computer to
                    connect to a network; also known as a network adapter or local area network adapter, it
                    typically supports connection to an Ethernet network.</li><br>
            </ul>

            <p>Other computing components, such as USB ports, power supplies, transistors and chips, are also types
                of internal hardware.</p><br><br>

            <h3>What Are External Hardware Components?</h3><br>

            <p>External hardware components, also called peripheral components, are those items that are often
                externally connected to the computer to control either input or output functions. These hardware
                devices are designed to either provide instructions to the software (input) or render results from
                its execution(output).</p><br>

            <p>Common input hardware components include the following:</p><br>

            <ul>
                <li>Mouse : A mouse is a hand-held pointing device that moves a cursor around a computer screen and
                    enables interaction with objects on the screen. It may be wired or wireless.</li><br>

                <li>Keyboard : A keyboard is an input device featuring a standard QWERTY keyset that enables users
                    to inputtext, numbers or special characters.</li><br>

                <li>Microp hone : A microphone is a device that translates sound waves into electrical signals
                    and supports computer-based audio communications.</li><br>

                <li>Camera : A camera captures visual images and streams them to the computer or through a
                    computer to a network device.</li><br>

                <li>Touchpad : A touchpad is an input device, external or built into a laptop, used to control
                    the pointer on a display screen. It is typically an alternative to an external mouse.</li><br>

                <li>USB flash drive : A USB flash drive is an external, removable storage device that uses flash
                    memory and interfaces with a computer through a USB port.</li><br>

                <li> Memory card : A memory card is a type of portable external storage media, such as a
                    CompactFlash card, used to store media or data files.</li><br>
            </ul>

            <p>Other input hardware components include joysticks, styluses and scanners.
            </p><br>

            <p>Examples of output hardware components include the following:</p><br>

            <ul>
                <li>Monitor : A monitor is an output device similar to a TV screen that displays information,
                    documents or images generated by the computing device.</li><br>

                <li>Printer : Printers render electronic data from a computer into printed material.</li><br>

                <li>Speaker. A speaker is an external audio output device that connects to a computer to generate a
                    sound output.</li><br>

                Headphones, earphones, earbuds. Similar to speakers, these devices provide audio output that's
                audibleonly to a single listener.
            </ul>
