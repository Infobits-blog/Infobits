            <h3>How To Maintain Software Quality ?</h3><br>

            <p>Software quality measures if the software meets both its functional and nonfunctional requirements.</p>
            <br>

            <p>Functional requirements identify what the software should do. They include technical details, data
                manipulation and processing, calculations and any other function that specifies what an application aims
                to
                accomplish.</p><br>

            <p>Nonfunctional requirements, also known as quality attributes, determine how the system should work.
                Nonfunctional requirements include portability, disaster recovery, security, privacy and usability.</p>
            <br>

            <p>Software testing detects and solves technical issues in the software source code and assesses the overall
                usability, performance, security and compatibility of the product to ensure it meets its requirements.
            </p><br>

            <p>The dimensions of software quality include the following characteristics:</p><br>

            <ul>
                <li>Accessibility : This is the degree to which a diverse group of people, including individuals who
                    require
                    adaptive technologies such as voice recognition and screen magnifiers, can comfortably use the
                    software.
                    Compatibility. This is the suitability of the software for use in a variety of environments.
                    Software
                    compatibility is important for different OSes, devices and browsers.</li><br>

                
                <li>Efficiency : This is the ability of the software to perform well without wasting energy, resources,
                    effort,
                    time or money.</li><br>

                <li>Functionality : This is software's ability to carry out its specified functions.
                    Installation. This is the ability of the software to be installed in a specified environment.</li>
                <br>

                <li>Localization : For software to function correctly, it needs localization, which entails the various
                    languages, time zones and other features a software program can works in.</li><br>

                <li>Maintainability : This is how easily the software can be modified to add and improve features and fix
                    bugs.
                    Performance. This is how fast the software performs under a specific load</li><br>

                <li>Portability : This is the ease with which the software can be transferred from one location to
                    another.
                    Reliability. This is the software's ability to perform a required function under specific conditions
                    and for
                    a defined period without any errors.</li><br>

                <li>Scalability : A software's ability to increase or decrease performance in response to changes in its
                    processing demands is its scalability.</li><br>

                <li>Security : This is the software's ability to protect against unauthorized access, invasion of
                    privacy, theft,
                    data loss and malicious software.</li><br>

                <li>Testability : This is how easy it is to test the software.
                    Usability. This is how easy it is to use the software.
                    To maintain software quality once it's deployed, developers must constantly adapt it to meet new
                    customer
                    requirements and handle problems customers identify. This includes improving functionality, fixing
                    bugs and
                    adjusting software code to prevent issues. How long a product lasts on the market depends on
                    developers'
                    ability to keep up with these maintenance requirements.</li><br>
            </ul>

            <p>When it comes to maintenance approaches, there are four types of changes developers can make, including
                the
                following:</p><br>

            <ul>
                <li>Corrective : Users often identify and report bugs that developers must fix, including coding errors
                    and other
                    problems that keep the software from meeting its requirements.</li><br>

                <li>Adaptive : Developers must regularly make changes to their software to ensure it's compatible with
                    changing
                    hardware and software environments, such as when a new version of the OS comes out.</li><br>

                <li>Perfective : These are changes that improve system functionality, such as improving the user
                    interface or
                    adjusting software code to enhance performance.</li><br>

                <li>Preventive. These changes keep software from failing and include tasks such as restructuring and
                    optimizing
                    code.</li>
            </ul>
