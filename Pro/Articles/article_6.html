            <h3>What Is A Motherboard?</h3><br>

            <p>A motherboard is the main printed circuit board (PCB) in a computer. The motherboard is a computer's
                central
                communications backbone connectivity point, through which all components and external peripherals
                connect.</p><br>

            <p>Motherboards can be found in virtually all computers, especially desktop and laptop PCs. The components
                that
                connect through them include chipsets, central processing units (CPU) and memory. The external
                peripherals
                include Wi-Fi, Ethernet and graphics cards with the graphics processing unit, or GPU.</p><br>

            <p>Motherboard manufacturers include Acer, ASRock, Asus, Gigabyte Technology, Intel and Micro-Star
                International.</p><br>

            <h3>How Do Motherboards Work?</h3><br>

            <p>The PCB of a large motherboard may include six to 14 layers of fiberglass, copper connecting traces and
                copper planes for power and signal isolation. Other components get added to a motherboard through
                expansion
                slots. These include processor sockets; dual in-line memory modules; Peripheral Component Interconnect
                (PCI), PCI Express (PCIe) and solid-state drive M.2 slots; as well as power supply connections.</p><br>

            <p>A heatsink and fan manage the heat components such as the CPU generate. Typically motherboards offer
                additional connectivity through a Southbridge chip such as PCI, Serial Advanced Technology Attachment or
                SATA, Thunderbolt, USB and other interfaces.</p><br>

            <p>The CPU is generally connected to double data rate 3 (DDR3), DDR4, DDR5 or onboard LPDDRx RAM and PCIe.
                This
                is done through point-to-point interconnects such as HyperTransport, Intel's QuickPath Interconnect and
                Ultra Path Interconnect. Choosing a motherboard often determines many features a computer will support.
            </p><br>

            <p>Motherboard designs in desktop computers typically are the ATX motherboard, which is Intel's improved
                version of IBM's AT design. Other form factor designers include the following:</p><br>

            <ul>
                <li> Extended ATX</li>
                <li> Mini-ATX</li>
                <li> Micro ATX</li>
                <li> BTX</li>
                <li> Micro BTX</li>
                <li> Mini-ITX</li>
                <li> Micro ITX</li>
                <li> Nano-ITX</li>
            </ul><br>

            <p>Some memory controllers are now built into CPUs; that has eliminated the Northbridge chips that provided
                memory management from the motherboard. Integrated video has moved from a motherboard slotted peripheral
                to
                graphics-enabled CPUs.</p><br>

            <p>AMD's Ryzen has a system-on-a-chip design that also makes the Southbridge chipset optional. This CPU
                integration has cut motherboard manufacturers' costs. They can offer base systems for workstations and
                entry-level computers and can design customized implementations for various processors that enable
                platform
                upgrades.</p><br>

            <p>Gaming motherboards are made for high-performance computers; they are more powerful and have more
                features
                than motherboards for desktop and laptop computers.</p><br>

            <h3>Motherboard Components</h3><br>

            <p>Each motherboard is designed to support specific components, such as CPUs and memory. They can
                accommodate
                most types of hard drives and peripherals.</p><br>

            <p>Motherboards include the following primary components:</p><br>

            <ul>

                <li>CPU with its logic circuitry that processes the instructions from programs, the operating system and
                    other
                    computer components;</li><br>

                <li>Memory where instructions and data are temporarily stored and executed;</li><br>

                <li>Storage interface for solid-state or hard disk drive for persistent data and application storage;
                </li><br>

                <li>ROM BIOS providing non-volatile memory that stores firmware, such as the basic input/output system
                    or BIOS;</li><br>

                <li>Northbridge chipset that connects CPU, memory, storage and other components;</li><br>

                <li>Southbridge chipset that connects peripheral elements to the motherboard and connects to the
                    Northbridge;</li><br>

                <li>Cooling fans that maintain a suitable internal operating temperature;</li><br>

                <li>Peripheral connector slots for plugin peripheral cards, such as graphics and communications
                    adapters;</li><br>

                <li>Connectors for peripheral devices such as USB ports and other connectors for external devices;</li>
                <br>

                <li>The backup battery that ensures key system configuration data is maintained when main power is
                    unavailable;</li><br>

                <li>The power connector, connecting to an external power source.</li><br>
            </ul>

            <p>Many other elements comprise a typical motherboard. Think of a motherboard as a large mosaic of
                electrical
                connections linking the various parts of a computer.</p>
