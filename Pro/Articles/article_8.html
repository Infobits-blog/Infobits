            <h3> What Is A Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)</h3><br>

            <p>A graphics processing unit (GPU) is a computer chip that renders graphics and images by performing rapid
                mathematical calculations. GPUs are used for both professional and personal computing. Originally, GPUs
                were
                responsible for the rendering of 2D and 3D images, animations and video, but now they have a wider use
                range.</p><br>

            <p>Like a central processing unit (CPU), a GPU is also a chip component in computing devices. One important
                difference, though, is that the GPU is specifically designed to handle and accelerate graphics workloads
                and
                display graphics content on a device such as a PC or smartphone.</p><br>

            <p>An electronic device with an embedded or discrete GPU can smoothly render 3D graphics and video content,
                making it suitable for gaming and other visual applications. Over time, technological improvements have
                resulted in more flexible and programmable GPUs that can be used for many more applications and
                workloads
                other than gaming. GPUs are now used for creative content production, video editing, high performance
                computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI).</p><br>

            <h3>What Does A GPU Do ?</h3><br>

            <p>In the early days of computing, the CPU performed the calculations required for graphics applications,
                such
                as the rendering of 2D and 3D images, animations and video. As more graphics-intensive applications were
                developed, however, their demands put a strain on the CPU and decreased the computer's overall
                performance.</p><br>

            <p>GPUs were developed as a way to offload those tasks from CPUs for graphics applications. A GPU performs
                graphics-related calculations very quickly and in parallel to allow for fast and smooth rendering of
                content
                on the computer screen. Since the GPU takes care of the calculations, the CPU is free to handle
                everything
                else that's not related to the graphics application.</p><br>

            <h3>How Does A GPU Work ?</h3><br>

            <p>GPUs work by using a method called parallel processing, where multiple processors handle separate parts
                of a
                single task. A GPU will also have its own RAM to store the data it is processing. This RAM is designed
                specifically to hold the large amounts of information coming into the GPU for highly intensive graphics
                use
                cases.</p><br>

            <p>For graphics applications, the CPU sends instructions to the GPU for drawing the graphics content on
                screen.
                The GPU executes the instructions in parallel and at high speeds to display the content on the device --
                a
                process known as the graphics or rendering pipeline.</p><br>

            <h3>GPU Use Cases : What GPUs Are Used For Today ?</h3><br>

            <p>GPUs are widely used for PC gaming, allowing for smooth, high-quality graphics rendering. Modern GPUs are
                also adapted to a wider variety of tasks than they were originally designed for, partially because they
                are
                more programmable than they were in the past. That's why GPUs are now also used to accelerate AI
                workloads
                and for machine learning (ML).</p><br>

            <p>Some of the most popular applications of GPUs include the following:</p><br>

            <ul>
                <li>Accelerating the rendering of real-time 2D and 3D graphics applications.</li><br>
                <li>Video editing and video content creation.</li><br>
                <li>Video game graphics.</li><br>
                <li>Accelerating ML applications such as image recognition and facial detection and recognition.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Training deep learning neural networks.</li><br>
            </ul>

            <p>In recent years, GPUs have also been used to mine bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum.
                GPUs
                can perform the high-speed, parallel mathematical calculations required for crypto mining -- something
                that
                regular laptops with regular CPUs just cannot do.</p><br>


            <h3>Types Of GPUs</h3><br>

            <p>Generally, there are two types of GPUs:</p><br>

            <ul>
                <li>Integrated GPUs : An integrated GPU is built into the computer's motherboard. It could also be
                    integrated
                    with the CPU. Systems with integrated GPUs are generally small and light, since less space is
                    required to
                    incorporate the GPU.</li><br>

                <p>GPU integration reduces the system's power consumption. In many cases, it also reduces the device's
                    cost.
                    That said, a laptop PC with an integrated GPU often is not upgradable, so if graphics needs change,
                    it might
                    require investing in an entirely new device.</p><br>

                <p>Today, gaming laptops are available that align with modern games' system requirements, including GPU
                    type
                    and speed. These laptops smoothly render the graphics for different kinds of games and enhance
                    gamers'
                    playing experiences.</p><br>

                <li>Discrete GPUs : A discrete or dedicated GPU can be mounted on a separate circuit board. It usually
                    exists in the form of a removable graphics card with powerful capabilities for resource-intensive,
                    high-performance applications such as 3D games.</li><br>

                <p>A discrete GPU adds more processing power to the computer and can be upgraded as the user's needs
                    change.
                    However, it consumes more energy than an integrated GPU. It also generates considerable heat and
                    will likely
                    require dedicated cooling to reduce the heat and maximize GPU and laptop performance.</p>
            </ul>
